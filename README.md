## 📋 Abstract

This repository provides the optimized atomic structures of **extended carbon nanocones (xCNCs)** derived from non-graphene two-dimensional carbon allotropes. The structures were investigated using a combined **density functional theory (DFT)** and **reactive molecular dynamics** approach.

### What's Inside

We investigated four precursor monolayers: **acepentalene**, **naphthylene**, and the topologically distinct **r469-New20** and **r568** lattices. From these, fifteen nanocone structures with disclination angles of 60°, 120°, and 180° were constructed and fully optimized at the **GGA-PBE/DNP** level of theory.

### Key Findings

- ✅ **Structural Stability**: All structures confirmed as true minima (no imaginary frequencies)
- ⚡ **Binding Energies**: Range from −6.823 to −7.547 eV/atom, comparable to C₆₀ fullerene (−7.558 eV)
- 🔌 **Electronic Properties**: HOMO-LUMO gaps span 0.030–1.045 eV, indicating tunable semiconducting behavior
- 🌡️ **Thermodynamic Feasibility**: Several xCNCs exhibit negative Gibbs free energies at 825–1000 K
- 🔥 **Thermal Stability**: Reactive MD simulations (AIREBO potential) confirm stability at 600 K with energy fluctuations below 0.12%
- 🎯 **Orbital Localization**: Edge-localized HOMOs and apex-localized LUMOs

These findings demonstrate that extended carbon nanocones are viable targets for experimental synthesis with potential applications in **nanoelectronics**, **catalysis**, and **sensing**.
